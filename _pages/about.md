Hello!  
======


I will be pursuing my PhD at the University of Florida using bioinformatics and DNA sequencing to research how soil microorganisms are connected to larger issues such as climate change, ecosystem functioning and sustainable agricultural practices. Soil microbes make up a large portion of the biodiversity in any ecosystem and are critically important for the overall health of the environment. My research has taken me to a wide range of places from tropical rainforests and urban cemeteries to the Mojave Desert and more. I love taking pictures of my experiences and sharing the photos with others. Please see some of my photos below.
